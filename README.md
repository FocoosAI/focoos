# Welcome to Focoos AI

Focoos AI provides an advanced development platform designed to empower developers and businesses with efficient, customizable computer vision solutions. Whether you're working with data from cloud infrastructures or deploying on edge devices, Focoos AI enables you to select, fine-tune, and deploy state-of-the-art models optimized for your unique needs.

## SDK Overview

<!-- Unlock the full potential of Focoos AI with the Focoos Python SDK! üöÄ  -->
The Focoos Python SDK is your gateway to easily access cutting-edge computer vision models and development tools. With just a few lines of code, you can **fine tune** pre-trained models tailored to your specific needs.

Whether you're working in the cloud or on edge devices, the Focoos Python SDK seamlessly integrates into your workflow, accelerating development and simplifying the implementation of computer vision solutions.

### Key Features üîë

1. **Frugal Pretrained Models** üåø
   Get started quickly by selecting one of our efficient, [pre-trained models](https://focoosai.github.io/focoos/models/) that best suits your data and application needs.
   Focoos Model Registry give access to 11 pretrained models of different size from different families: RTDetr, Maskformer, BisenetFormer

2. **Fine Tune Your Model** ‚ú® Adapt the model to your specific use case by customize its config and training it on your own dataset.

4. **Optimized Inference** üñ•Ô∏è Export Models and run inference efficiently, Leverage hardware acceleration through Torchscript, TensorRT and ONNX for maximum performance.

5. **FocoosHub Integration** üîÑ Seamlessly integrate with Focoos Cloud to access your models and data, you can also run cloud inference on managed models.

# Quickstart üöÄ
Ready to dive in? Get started with the setup in just a few simple steps!

## Installation
**Install** the Focoos Python SDK (for more options, see [setup](https://focoosai.github.io/focoos/setup))

```bash linenums="0"
uv pip install 'focoos @ git+https://github.com/FocoosAI/focoos.git'
```

## Inference

```python
from focoos.model_registry import ModelRegistry
from focoos.model_manager import ModelManager

image_path = "./image.jpg"

model = ModelManager.get("fai-detr-l-obj365") # any models from ModelRegistry, FocoosHub or local folder

detections = model(image_path)

```

## Training

```python
from focoos.data.default_aug import get_default_by_task
from focoos.ports import TrainerArgs, Task
from focoos.data.auto_dataset import AutoDataset
from focoos.model_manager import ModelManager
from focoos.ports import DatasetSplitType, DatasetLayout, RuntimeType

ds_name = "my_dataset.zip"
task = Task.DETECTION
layout = DatasetLayout.ROBOFLOW_COCO

auto_dataset = AutoDataset(dataset_name=ds_name, task=task, layout=layout)

train_augs, val_augs = get_default_by_task(task, 640, advanced=False)
train_dataset = auto_dataset.get_split(augs=train_augs.get_augmentations(), split=DatasetSplitType.TRAIN)
valid_dataset = auto_dataset.get_split(augs=val_augs.get_augmentations(), split=DatasetSplitType.VAL)


model = ModelManager.get("fai-detr-l-obj365")

args = TrainerArgs(
    run_name=f"{ds_name}-{model.model_info.name}",
    batch_size=16,
    max_iters=50,
    eval_period=50,
    learning_rate=0.0008,
    sync_to_hub=False,  # use this to sync model info, weights and metrics on the hub
)


model.train(args, train_dataset, valid_dataset)
```

## Export and optimized Inference

```python
from focoos.model_manager import ModelManager
from focoos.ports import RuntimeType


model = ModelManager.get("fai-detr-l-obj365")
infer_model = model.export(runtime_type=RuntimeType.TORCHSCRIPT_32)
infer_model.benchmark()

```
