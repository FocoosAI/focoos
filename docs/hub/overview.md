# ðŸš€ Focoos HUB Overview
The Focoos HUB is a cloud-based platform that provides seamless integration between your local development environment and the Focoos AI ecosystem. It enables you to manage models, datasets, perform remote inference operations, and monitor training progress through a unified API.

## What is Focoos HUB?

Focoos HUB serves as your gateway to:

- **Model Management**: Store, version, and share your trained computer vision models
- **Remote Inference**: Run inference on cloud infrastructure without local GPU requirements
- **Dataset Management**: Upload, download, and manage datasets in the cloud
- **Collaboration**: Share models and datasets with team members
- **Monitoring**: Track model performance and usage metrics

## Key Components

### FocoosHUB Client
The main interface for interacting with the Focoos platform. It provides authentication and access to all HUB services.

```python
from focoos import FocoosHUB

# Initialize the HUB client
hub = FocoosHUB()

# Get user information
user_info = hub.get_user_info()
print(f"Welcome {user_info.email}!")
```

### Remote Models
Access and manage models stored in the cloud:

- List your available models
- Get detailed model information
- Download models for local use
- Perform remote inference without downloading

### Remote Datasets
Manage datasets in the cloud:

- Upload local datasets to the cloud
- Download shared datasets
- Access dataset metadata and specifications
- List available datasets (owned and shared)

## Getting Started

To start using Focoos HUB:

1. **Authentication**: Set up your API key in the configuration
2. **Initialize**: Create a FocoosHUB instance
3. **Explore**: List your models and datasets
4. **Use**: Run inference or manage your ML artifacts

See the [HUB](hub.md) section for detailed usage examples and the [Remote Inference](remote_inference.md) guide for cloud-based inference workflows.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Access to cloud GPU resources for inference
- **Collaboration**: Easy sharing of models and datasets
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use inference without maintaining infrastructure
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow between local development and cloud deployment
