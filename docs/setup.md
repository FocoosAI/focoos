# Python SDK Setup üêç

Focoos models support multiple inference runtimes. The library can be used without any extras for training and inference using the PyTorch runtime. Additional extras are only needed if you want to use ONNX or TensorRT runtimes for optimized inference.

| RuntimeType | Extra | Runtime | Compatible Devices | Available ExecutionProvider |
|------------|-------|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| TORCHSCRIPT_32 | - | torchscript | CPU, NVIDIA GPUs | - |
| ONNX_CUDA32 | `[onnx]` | onnxruntime GPU | NVIDIA GPUs | CUDAExecutionProvider |
| ONNX_TRT32 | `[tensorrt]` | onnxruntime TRT | NVIDIA GPUs (Optimized) | CUDAExecutionProvider, TensorrtExecutionProvider |
| ONNX_TRT16 | `[tensorrt]` | onnxruntime TRT | NVIDIA GPUs (Optimized) | CUDAExecutionProvider, TensorrtExecutionProvider |
| ONNX_CPU | `[onnx-cpu]` | onnxruntime CPU | CPU (x86, ARM), M1, M2, M3 (Apple Silicon) | CPUExecutionProvider, CoreMLExecutionProvider, AzureExecutionProvider |
| ONNX_COREML | `[onnx-cpu]` | onnxruntime CPU | M1, M2, M3 (Apple Silicon) | CoreMLExecutionProvider, CPUExecutionProvider |


## Install the Focoos SDK
The Focoos SDK can be installed with different package managers using python 3.10 and above.

=== "uv"
    We recommend using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (how to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)) as a package manager and environment manager for a streamlined dependency management experience.

    You can easily create a new virtual environment with UV using the following command:
    ```bash linenums="0"
    uv venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    === "Torch Runtime"
        ```bash linenums="0"
        uv pip install 'focoos @ git+https://github.com/FocoosAI/focoos.git'

!!! note
    ü§ñ **Multiple Runtimes:** You can install multiple extras by running `pip install 'focoos[onnx,tensorrt] @ git+https://github.com/FocoosAI/focoos.git'`. Note that you can't use `onnx-cpu` and `onnx` or `tensorrt` at the same time.

!!! note
    üõ†Ô∏è **Installation Tip:** If you want to install a specific version, for example `v0.1.3`, use:

## Docker and Devcontainers
For container support, Focoos offers different Docker images:

- `focoos-cpu`: only CPU
- `focoos-onnx`: Includes ONNX (CUDA) support
- `focoos-tensorrt`: Includes ONNX and TensorRT support

to use the docker images, you can run the following command:

```bash linenums="0"
docker build -t focoos-gpu . --target=focoos-gpu
docker run -it focoos-gpu
```

This repository also includes a devcontainer configuration for each of the above images. You can launch these devcontainers in Visual Studio Code for a seamless development experience.
